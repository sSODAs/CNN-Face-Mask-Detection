# CNN-Face-Mask-Detection
A complete face mask detection system built using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with advanced image preprocessing and real-time inference support.

This project was developed as part of an academic course and demonstrates the full pipeline — from dataset preparation and model training to evaluation and webcam-based deployment.
